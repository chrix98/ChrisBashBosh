to use host specific setups, get the hostname of your machine and then create a
directory with the name of "enabled-HOSTNAME" 

example, get your hostname like:
$> hostname -f

if the result of the above were lets say "Chris-Super-PC" then you'd create a dir 
like:
enabled-Chris-Super-PC

inside that directory you create symlinks to the files in "available-global" that 
you may want available to that host, i.e.

ln -s ../available-global/variables.path


Alternatively you can store real files in the hostname dirs ...
